# Discord News Bot

This Discord bot is that takes news headlines from the Dexerto website and automatically shares them to your Discord server. More news sites can be added in the future, why not :)

## Installation
For the bot to work, you need install packages and to create an .env file and include your bot's token and your MongoDB connection. The .env file should be as follows:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=""
MONGO="mongodb+srv://"
```
Also, you should check this line occasionally because /data/5Dz_UiVJXTWIp-h2oMbin/ may vary: [here](https://github.com/cyber-cute/discord-news/blob/main/src/utils/fetchNews.js#L5)

Thank you [Tolgchu](https://github.com/Tolga1452) for the discord.js template for this bot
